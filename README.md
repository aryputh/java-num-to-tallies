## java-num-to-tallies - A number to tally mark converter.
A java file that converts a given number to tallies.

### Important
When converting, the final result will end up showing 5's and 1's. This is due to the fact there aren't any tally mark symbols to use.

5 = A group of five.
1 = A group of one.

### Remixing

This project doesn't catach any errors. The project doesn't take negative numbers, input other than integers, but will still accept it from the user.

### Examples
12 = 5511 (5 + 5 + 1 + 1 = 12)
0 = NONE
2 = 11 (1 + 1 = 2)
99 = 55555555555555555551111 (5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 99)
