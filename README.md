## java-num-to-tallies - A number to tally mark converter.
A java file that converts a given number to tallies.

### Important
When converting, the finall result will end up showing 5's and 1's. This is due to the fact there aren't any tally mark symbols to use.

5 = A group of five.
1 = A group of one.

### Remixing
Since this is a basic, bare bones project, you may remix/add anything you want to it! No credit is required but is appreciated.
